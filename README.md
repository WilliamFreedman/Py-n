# Py+^n

Currently building the parser / scanner for our language.

LRM [link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19qIKJs5IrcalFDOtZ086bfdhxixGeDrwkZcURITzKRQ/edit?usp=sharing) (for reference)

Try running `ocamlbuild scanner.native` in the `src\parsing` directory.
Doesn't compile at the moment.

## Hellow World Front-End Checkpoint Update

So far, we have completed the scanner and the parser, with a functioning AST pretty printer.

We also have included a few test files that demonstrate important features of our language.
